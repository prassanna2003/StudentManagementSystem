The Student Management System is a software project that aims to create a system for managing and storing student information in an educational institution. The project consists of the following components:

- A Student class that represents individual students. This class has attributes such as name, roll number, grade, and any other relevant details. The class also has methods to get and set the values of these attributes.
- A StudentManagementSystem class that manages the collection of students. This class has methods to add a new student, remove an existing student, search for a student by name or roll number, and display all the students in the system.
- A user interface for the Student Management System. This can be either a console-based interface or a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Swing or JavaFX. The user interface allows users to perform various operations on the student data, such as adding, editing, deleting, searching, and viewing.
- A storage mechanism for the student data. This can be either a file or a database. The project implements methods to read and write the student data from and to the storage mechanism.
- An input validation mechanism to ensure that the required fields are not left empty and that the student data is in the correct format. The project checks the validity of the user input before performing any operation on the student data.

The project uses Java as the programming language and MySQL as the database. The project follows the object-oriented design principles and uses UML diagrams to model the system. The project also includes documentation and testing of the system.
